# Python-Multi_Threading-Vs-Multi_Processing

In this module we benchmark python's multithreading and multiprocessing. We are doing I/O operations  
and Compute Intesive Operations to see which method of concurrency or parallism performs better in 
which scenario. The concurrent.futures module is used to perform the multithreading and multiprocessing
functionality.
